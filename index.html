                                Working with Brandon has been an excellent experience. Starting at the beginning of his course at GW Brandon expressed the desire and aptitude to 
                                learn the core material of our full stack course. Not only did he ask excellent questions that helped his peers see the subject matter more clearly, 
                                but he developed the ability to quickly apply the concepts he was taught to the frame works of his own code.
                                Brandon’s ability to work well with teams and express a leadership role was apparent from his first project in the course. He also finished the course 
                                working on an application in a solo project and showed his strong ability to learn and drive his work independently. I believe that Brandon would be
                                a fantastic addition to any work team and I sincerely hope to have an opportunity to collaborate with him in the future.
